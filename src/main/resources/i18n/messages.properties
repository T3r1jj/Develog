indexFirstParagraph=<p>Have you ever had to solve a complex problem and jumped straight into implementation? Let him who have not, cast the first stone. Have you ever wandered into the land of endless ifs end elses? Why not escape this misery and start short-term planning? Plan. Plan daily. Plan small implementation tasks. Log general overviews. Use Markdown for necessary formatting. Swiftly create UML diagrams. Everything is now possible with <strong>Develog</strong>.</p><p>Develog is a web app dedicated to programmer. It supports the process of problem solving and active learning. First, think about your task then write down possible solutions. Try solving the problem and review the process. Log down what works or what could be improved. It will help you keeping the mind clean. After any distraction, you can always go back into the flow by checking the log.</p>
indexSecondParagraph=<p>Develog is a plain text web editor. It has been build on Markdown and PlantUML. This way you can write using easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format which is then automatically converted to HTML. Aside from Markdown, you can also use PlantUML syntax in similar way to easily create diagrams. This integration provides not only UML charting capabilities but also many more features like wireframing; Archimate, Gantt diagrams and many more. The language is as simple as Markdown. The app consists of a WYSIWYG editor which displays generated content. Ultimately, you can export to plain text format as well as HTML document.</p><p>The application follows a simple rule which is - daily logging. For each day only one note can be created and edited. The only exception is a single global note. This is to keep you on track with the logging idea. Each note will be dated so it will be possible to review them at latter time. There are also tags, which help aggregate logs from different dates into one when searching. And that's it! Simple isn't it? If you're interested, sign in with GitHub and try it out.</p>
